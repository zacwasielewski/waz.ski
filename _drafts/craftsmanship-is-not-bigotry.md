<p>Ted Dziuba recently published an insightful blog post, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;teddziuba.com&#47;post&#47;58003369831&#47;mastering-the-craft">Mastering the Craft<&#47;a>, in which he argues that delivering business value is more important than&mdash;or at least as important as&mdash;technical wizardry.</p>
<p>To illustrate, he invokes this anecdote about a Vegas bartender:</p>
<blockquote><p>This guy is truly a master of his craft. He know all the technical details of the domain, and is creative enough to invent fantastic drinks. But beyond all that, most importantly, he knows that barcraft is fundamentally about giving the customer what they want. My friends and I wanted to talk about high end bourbon. Brody McBroderson wanted to get hammered.</p>
<p>The true master obliges both.<&#47;blockquote><br />
That's a valuable bit of wisdom. Dziuba carries it forward, creating an analogy with software engineering:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If you&rsquo;ve coded in Ruby, Python, or any modern framework language, would you take a job at a Java shop?<&#47;em></p>
<p>I suspect that a lot of people wouldn&rsquo;t, because of programming language bigotry. I would take a job at a Java shop (I did, in fact, even though I resisted it for two years) because I feel orders of magnitude more useful delivering <em>business value<&#47;em> than I feel delivering <em>code<&#47;em>.<&#47;blockquote><br />
Now, I generally agree with Dziuba's thesis, but not his conclusion of "programming language bigotry."</p>
<p>Every craft has its tools. Bartenders have their ingredients and mixing tools; software developers have their programming languages and editors.</p>
<p>Dziuba seems to underestimate the importance of frictionless, well-designed tools. Anyone who's ever pounded a nail knows the value of a solid hammer, both in efficiency and satisfaction. Business value can be delivered using a wide range of tools. Why shouldn't we choose &nbsp;developer choose the most efficient, satisfying, and productive tools available?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not saying Dziuba is&nbsp;<em>wrong,<&#47;em> only that we</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it's not bigotry.</p>
<p>- analogy is wrong:</p>
<p>1. mixing tools : language :: drink : software</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>1. bartender doesn't create basic products full-time</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- dziuba underestimates value of craftsmanship</p>
<p>- craftsmanship and usefulness are complementary</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the analogy doesn't hold up.&nbsp;He compares apples to oranges, programming languages to cocktails. In reality, the developer's programming language is the bartender's ingredients and mixing tools; the software product is the drink.</p>
<p>But more importantly, I think Dziuba understates the importance of enjoying your craft. Yes, the bartender</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Vegas bartender enjoys producing a quality product, yet is also pleased to oblige his undiscerning customers. I can relate; my preferred programming language is Ruby, but I often accept freelance PHP work from clients who couldn't care less about the underlying code. Like the bartender, I "make the hell" out of those clients' web sites, but also appreciate any chance to work on the "elegant" projects.</p>
<p>If the bartender&nbsp;<em>only<&#47;em> served Brody McBroderson, I suspect he'd be dusting off his r&eacute;sum&eacute;. That doesn't make him a bigot, it makes him a craftsman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, two aspects of the bartender's and developer's roles contribute to their perceived "usefulness": the product they deliver, and the tools they're afforded.</p>
<p>Section: attack straw man of usefulness and business value</p>
<p>Furthermore, it seems that Dziuba is setting up a straw man: use boring tools to perform interesting, valuable work vs.</p>
<p>It's true that a lot of people wouldn't take a Java job, but not because of "programming language bigotry." Ruby and Python make development easier, efficient, and enjoyable. Most carpenters prefer solid, effective tools &mdash; are they also bigots? The Vegas bartender is happy to occasionally serve a basic drink to an undiscerning customer, but if that's all he did, I bet he'd be working on his r&eacute;sum&eacute;. He's not a cocktail bigot, he simply enjoys crafting fine products using quality tools.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy Ruby and Python because they (and their frameworks) are quality tools that make programming enjoyable. If I had to choose between writing simple web sites in Ruby on Rails or solving complex, interesting problems with Java, then I'd also probably choose the Java job. But</p>
