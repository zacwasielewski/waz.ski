I’m Zac Wasielewski, a web developer living in Utica, New York. I spend my free time skiing, rock climbing, drinking a variety of beers, and hanging out with my family. This site is an attempt to document my thoughts on all of the above. If you’re interested in rock climbing and the outdoors, check out my climbing blog, [Negative Ape](http://negativeape.com/), and bouldering tick list app, [Boulder Problems](http://boulderproblems.com/).

I’m occasionally available for freelance work, especially Ruby on Rails or JavaScript development. Check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zac-wasielewski-6072361">LinkedIn profile</a> and <a href="mailto:zac@wasielewski.org">contact me</a> if you have a job that fits my skills.

If social networking is more your style, I'm <a href="http://twitter.com/xac">xac on Twitter</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/xac">xac on Instagram</a>.
