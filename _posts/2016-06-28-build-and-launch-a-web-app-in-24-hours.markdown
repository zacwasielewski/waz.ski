Some of my worst development habits are [yak shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving), [bikeshedding](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding), and [analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis). If there’s *any* way to sweat minor details for hours, I’ll find it. I’ve quieted these tendencies throughout my career, but still find myself overanalyzing, fiddling, and researching more than I’d like. And while this can lead to serendipitous learning opportunities, it also leads to missed deadlines.

So I’m giving myself a fun challenge to practice focus and time management: develop and launch a web app in one “day” (twenty-four total hours of work). Before beginning, I’ll present hourly estimates for each phase of the project, and then strictly limit my time to those estimates.

I’ll be building a results search for a popular local road race on Sunday, July 10th (eleven days from today). So, on top of the self-imposed constraints, there’s a hard deadline.

Naturally, the web app will be a [minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product), but should be functional enough to be used, and hopefully shared, by real people. Here’s a preliminary list of features, which may evolve:

- A user can search for results (place/time) by name, bib #, or hometown.
- After finding their results, a user can view an animated map comparing their race progress to the winner’s.
- A user can sign up for text alerts to be notified as soon as results are available (on race day).
- A user can easily share their results page on social media.
- An admin can import race results in one click

## Phase 1: Product Design
- Finalize feature list: *1 hour*
- Sketches/wireframes: *1 hour*

## Phase 2: Backend/API
- Bootstrap development platform: *1 hour*
- Model database schema: *1 hour*
- Build user views and API endpoints: *4 hours*
- Build admin import function: *2 hours*

## Phase 3: Frontend/UI
- Build static UI in HTML/CSS: *3 hours*
- Build dynamic race visualization UI: *4 hours*

## Phase 4: Production
- Find and register domain: *1/2 hour*
- Set up hosting: *1/2 hour*
- Deploy to production: *1 hour*

## Phase 5: Finalize
- Test: *2 hours*
- Fix bugs: *3 hours*

This may not seem *terribly* ambitious, but with a full time job, a separate ongoing project, and a two-month-old baby at home, my free time is extremely limited—so it will be a sprint to make this happen. I’m excited to see how this experiment works out, and will post updates on its progress.
